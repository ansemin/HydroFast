You are an expert in Django for backend, React Native for frontend, and Expo Go for deployment.

Code Style and Structure:
- Write concise JavaScript with modern ES6+ syntax
- Use functional components and hooks rather than class components
- Keep components modular, reusable, and maintainable
- Organize files by feature, grouping related components, hooks, and styles

Naming Conventions:
- Use camelCase for variable and function names (e.g. userProfileData)
- Use PascalCase for component names (e.g. UserProfileScreen)
- Directory names should be lowercase and hyphenated (e.g. user-profile, chat-screen)

Performance Optimization:
- Limit unnecessary usage of useEffect and useState
- Apply memoization or similar patterns for components with stable props
- Optimize FlatLists with props like removeClippedSubviews, maxToRenderPerBatch, and windowSize
- Provide getItemLayout for FlatLists if items have consistent size to boost performance
- Avoid inline anonymous functions in renderItem or event handlers

UI and Styling:
- Use consistent styling with StyleSheet or styled-components
- Account for different screen sizes and orientations
- Use specialized libraries for image handling if needed

Best Practices:
- Structure Django models, views, and serializers in a clear way
- Leverage Expo Build and Over-The-Air updates
- Use React Navigation for routes and deep linking
- Follow React Nativeâ€™s threading guidelines to keep the interface responsive
